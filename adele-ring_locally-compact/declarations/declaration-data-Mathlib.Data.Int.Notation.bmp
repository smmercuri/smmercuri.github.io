It is defined as an inductive type based on the\nnatural number type `Nat` featuring two constructors: \"a natural\nnumber is an integer\", and \"the negation of a successor of a natural\nnumber is an integer\". The former represents integers between `0`\n(inclusive) and `∞`, and the latter integers between `-∞` and `-1`\n(inclusive).\n\nThis type is special-cased by the compiler. The runtime has a special\nrepresentation for `Int` which stores \"small\" signed numbers directly,\nand larger numbers use an arbitrary precision \"bignum\" library\n(usually [GMP](https://gmplib.org/)). A \"small number\" is an integer\nthat can be encoded with 63 bits (31 bits on 32-bits architectures).\n"},"header":"<div class=\"decl_header\"><span class=\"decl_kind\">def</span>\n<span class=\"decl_name\"><a class=\"break_within\" href=\"./Mathlib/Data/Int/Notation.html#termℤ\"><span class=\"name\">termℤ</span></a></span><span class=\"decl_args\"> :</span><div class=\"decl_type\"><a href=\"./Init/Prelude.html#Lean.ParserDescr\">Lean.ParserDescr</a></div></div>"}]}
